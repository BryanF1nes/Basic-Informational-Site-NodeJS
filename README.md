# Basic-Informational-Site-NodeJS #

Although this project is nothing crazy special its re-ignited a passion for programming like no other! The last time this initial passion came to me was when I wrote my very first line of JavaScript,
just a simple Hello World script. I've always enjoyed programming from that point onward. Even though there have been some difficult moments where programming has challenged me, this entry level NodeJS
application has given me a burning passion to learn so much more and consider this a possible direction in a future as a software developer! I always thought I would try to focus more on frontend opportunities
and I may still, however right now I've got an itch for full-stack and backend development and I'm extremely happy to be on this journey!
